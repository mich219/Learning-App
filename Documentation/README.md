Welcome to my Learning App.

To use this app: 

You are required to write you notes in the .md format.

You must try to implement the following naming conventions:
- Folder = Field (this should be the overarching field of the subject eg "Cryptography")
- File name = Subject (this should relate to a specific Subject of the Field eg "AES.md")

The following syntax is relevent (the program will store the titles and the corresponding text underneath):
#
##
###
####

when the question is generated it will appear as a line with the following parameters:

Folder, File, #, ##, ###, ####
